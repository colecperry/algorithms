# Purpose of the Algorithm:
# - To find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) â€” a subset of edges that connects all nodes with the smallest total edge weight, without forming any cycles. It is particularly efficient on sparse graphs.

# Kruskal's Algorithm - High-Level Steps:
# 1. Sort all edges in the graph in non-decreasing order by weight.
# 2. Initialize a Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure to track connected components.
# 3. Iterate over each edge (u, v, weight) in sorted order:
#    a. Use 'find' to check if u and v are in different sets (i.e., not already connected).
#    b. If they are in different sets:
#        i. Add the edge to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
#        ii. Union their sets to mark them as connected.
# 4. Repeat until the MST contains (V - 1) edges or all edges have been processed.

# Time Complexity:
# - Sorting edges: O(E log E)
# - Union-Find operations: nearly O(1) each, amortized with path compression and union by rank
# - Total: O(E log E), which dominates the runtime

# Space Complexity:
# - O(V + E) for the disjoint set data structure, storing edges, and MST
