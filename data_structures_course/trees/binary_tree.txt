Binary Tree - a tree where every node has at most two children

It consists of:
    - A root node
    - Each node may have zero, one, or two children
    - The structure continues recursively down the tree

As opposed to the binary search tree which has an ordering rule where left subtree < Node < right subtree, a binary tree has no ordering rule. This is not great for searching efficiency! Also, a binary tree may or may not allow duplicates, as to where a binary search tree does not allow duplicates

- Big O of searching a binary tree: At worst case O(n) vs a Binary Search Tree (O(log n))

Example:
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F
