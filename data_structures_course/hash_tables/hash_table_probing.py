"""
üìå Hash Table Implementation using Open Addressing (Linear Probing) - each table entry contains either an element, or a null -> we store a single list

üîπ Features:
    - `insert(key)`: Inserts a key using linear probing -> we successively probe the hash table until we find an empty slot in which to put the key
        - Best case time complexity: O(1) -> if there is no collision, we place the key directly into it's hashed index
        - Average case time complexity: O(1) -> a well distributed hash function ensures few collisions, leading to few probes before finding an empty slot
        - Worst case: O(n) -> if many elements collide into the same cluster, we may have to probe the entire table before finding an empty slot
        - Brute force: O(n) -> scan the entire list for duplicates before inserting
    - `search(key)`: Searches for a key in the hash table -> probe the same sequence of slots that the insertion algorithm examined
        - Best case time complexity: O(1) -> if no collision happened, the key is found at it's hashed index immediately
        - Average case time complexity: O(1) -> with a low load factor, a few probes might be needed to locate the key
        - Worst case time complexity: O(n) -> if keys are clustered, we might need to probe n-1 slots before finding the key or confirming it's missing
        - Brute force: O(n) -> scan through the entire list to find the key
    - `delete(key)`: Deletes a key (marks it as "DELETED")
        - Best case time complexity: O(1) -> if the key is at it's expected index, it's marked "DELETED" instantly
        - Average case time complexity: O(1) -> with a well distributed hash function, deletion required few probes
        - Worst case time complexity: O(n) -> if clustering is bad, we may have to scan through many slots to find the key
        - Brute force: O(n) -> scan through the entire list to find and remove the key O(n)

üîπ Linear Probing:
    - If a collision occurs, probe the next available slot.
    - If the table is full, insertion fails.
    - Deleted keys are marked as `"DELETED"` to preserve search sequence
    - If we earlier had a collision and marked the key as None instead of "Deleted", we would hit none in our search sequence before we found our ele
