ðŸ“Œ Bucket Sort Algorithm

ðŸ”¹ High-Level Overview:
   - Bucket Sort is a **distribution-based sorting algorithm** that divides elements into several "buckets" and then sorts each bucket individually.
   - It is particularly useful when sorting floating-point numbers or numbers that are **uniformly distributed** (have an equal chance of occuring)

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
   1. **Create empty buckets** based on the number of elements.
   2. **Distribute elements** into the appropriate buckets based on their values.
   3. **Sort each bucket** individually (usually using another sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort or Python's Timsort).
   4. **Concatenate all sorted buckets** to form the final sorted array.

ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity Analysis:
   - **Best Case:** O(n) (if elements are evenly distributed and sorting within buckets is efficient)
   - **Average Case:** O(n + k) (where `k` is the number of buckets)
   - **Worst Case:** O(n^2) (if all elements fall into the same bucket and sorting is O(n^2))

ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity:
   - **O(n + k)** (O(n) for input and O(k) for buckets)

âœ… Best Used For:
    - Sorting floating-point numbers
    - Uniformly distributed data
    - Cases where another efficient sorting method (like Insertion Sort) can be used within small buckets
