Greedy Algorithm for Interval Partitioning

This algorithm finds the minimum number of resources required to schedule intervals 
without overlapping.

Approach (Earliest Start Time First):
1. Sort the intervals by their start time (greedy choice).
2. Use a min-heap to track the end times of currently used resources.
3. Allocate a new resource if no existing resource is available at the intervalâ€™s start time.
4. Return the maximum number of resources used at any time.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting and heap operations.
