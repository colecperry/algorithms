# 404. Sum of Left Leaves

# Topics: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

# A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

# Example 1:
#
#            3
#           / \
#          /   \
#         9     20
#               / \
#              15  7
#
#
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 24
# Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 0

# How to Solve (BFS):
    # Create a deque with the first element as the root and the second a boolean to tell us if it's a left node
    # Create a variable to store the total sum
    # Loop through the queue, pop the first element and destructure it getting the node and is_left boolean
    # If the node has no childern and is a left node, add that node's value to the total sum
        # Append the left and right nodes with the boolean, try not to append null nodes

"""
    ðŸ•’ Time Complexity: O(N)
    - Each node is visited exactly once â†’ O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
    - Enqueue and dequeue operations each take O(1).
    - Final time complexity: O(N).

    ðŸ–¥ Space Complexity: O(N) (worst case), O(log N) (best case)
    - In a balanced tree, the queue holds at most one level at a time â†’ O(log N).
    - In a skewed tree (like a linked list), each node is enqueued and dequeued N times, leading to O(N) operations
    - Final space complexity: O(N) (worst case), O(log N) (best case).
