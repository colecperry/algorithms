# 100. Same Tree

# Topics: Tree, DFS, BFS, Binary Tree

# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# Ex. 1

#           1              1
#         /   \          /   \
#        2     3        2     3
# 
#  
# Input: p = [1,2,3]   q = [1,2,3]
# Output : True


# Ex. 2

#           1              1
#         /                  \
#        2                    2
# 
#  
# Input: p = [1,2]   q = [1,null,3]
# Output : False

# Ex. 3

#           1              1
#         /   \          /   \
#        2     1        1     2
# 
#  
# Input: p = [1,2,1]   q = [1,1,2]
# Output : False

# How to Solve (DFS):
    # Check the root nodes -> 4 cases
        # 1. They are both null (empty nodes) -> Return True to prev call stack
        # 2. Only one is null (empty node) -> Return False to caller (non identical structure)
        # 3. The values are non equal -> Return False to the caller (non identical values)
        # 4. The values are equal -> Continue and recursively call the function on the left subtree (continues until we reach Base Case -> one of the three returns), and on the right subtree
        # The variables we store the boolean in represent the left subtree being the same from the node of the caller 
            # Ex. p = [1,2,1], q = [1,2,1], left_same = True means that the left subtreee of the root nodes are identical
            # We basically keep calling this recursively until we hit a False -> The left or right subtrees are not identical, or we hit a True -> we get to a base case where both nodes are none, so we return True all the way back to the root node caller
        # Return the result (both left and right subtrees must be True)

    # Time complexity: O(p + q) -> Worst case we have to iterate through every node in both trees
    # Space complexity: -> O(h): If the tree is balanced, the max deapth of recursion is O(log n) because at each level the tree splits into two subtrees, and for a skewed tree, each recursive call only processes one child at a time, resulting in n recursive calls in total before reaching the base case -> O(n)

# How to Solve(BFS):
    # When comparing two trees, it almost always makes more sense to use one deque with a tuple (each tuple representing one pair of nodes to comapare at that moment). This helps:
        # - Simplify iteration
        # - Fewer edge cases
        # - Less code
        # - Less risk of synchronization issues

    # Initialize a deque with a tuple of both root nodes, loop and dequeue (pop from front) -> Check:
        # 1. If both nodes are None -> trees are still the same
        # 2. If only one node is None (different structure) -> return False
        # 3. If node values are None (different values) -> return False
    # Append the left and right children (tuples) to the queue and continue to next iteration

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - Each node in both trees is processed exactly once.
# - Since we traverse all nodes, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the trees.

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# - In the worst case (if the trees are completely unbalanced), the queue holds O(n) nodes.
# - In the best case (if the trees are balanced), the queue holds O(log n) nodes at a time.
# - Overall, the worst-case space complexity is O(n).
