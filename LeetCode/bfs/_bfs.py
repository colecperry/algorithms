BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS) COMPLETE GUIDE
=================================================================

WHAT IS BFS?
-----------
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level,
visiting all nodes at distance d before visiting nodes at distance d+1.

Key characteristics:
- Uses a QUEUE (FIFO - First In, First Out) data structure
- Explores all neighbors at current level before going deeper
- Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs

WHEN TO USE BFS VS DFS
======================

Use BFS when:
- Need shortest path/minimum steps in unweighted graphs
- Need to process nodes level by level
- Want guaranteed minimum distance/depth
- Multi-source problems (start from multiple points)

Use DFS when:
- Memory is limited (stack uses less space than queue)
- Need to explore all paths (backtracking)
- Tree problems without level requirements
- Recursive solutions are more natural

BFS COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
=======================

TIME COMPLEXITY:
- Tree BFS: O(n) - visit each node exactly once
- Grid BFS: O(rows × cols) - visit each cell at most once  
- Graph BFS: O(V + E) - visit each vertex once, examine each edge once

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- Queue: O(w) where w = maximum width of tree/level
- Visited set: O(n) for nodes/cells visited
- Total: O(n) in most cases

BFS vs DFS Space Comparison:
- BFS: Queue can store entire level (wide trees use more space)
- DFS: Recursion stack depth equals height (deep trees use more space)
- Choose based on expected tree/graph structure

KEY INSIGHTS FOR INTERVIEWS
===========================

1. Always handle empty/null inputs first
2. Use deque for O(1) append/popleft operations
3. Track visited nodes/cells to prevent cycles (except pure trees)
4. Process entire levels when level information needed
5. Multi-source BFS: add all sources to initial queue
6. Early termination: first occurrence in BFS is guaranteed minimum
7. Simultaneous traversal: handle null cases carefully
8. Flood fill: check boundaries and conditions before adding to queue
