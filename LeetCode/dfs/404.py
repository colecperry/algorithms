# 404. Sum of Left Leaves

# Topics: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

# A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

# Example 1:
#
#            3
#           / \
#          /   \
#         9     20
#               / \
#              15  7
#
#
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 24
# Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 0

# How to Solve (DFS):
    # We need a way to know if the node we are recursively searching is a left leaf node:   
        # To figure out if the node is a leaf node, we can check if the current node has a .left and .right
        # Each time we recurse left, we pass another argument is_left and set it to True, that way, we can use that to find out if the node is a left node (meaning we recursed left to get here)
        # If we find a left leaf node, we update the global variable total_sum

"""
    ðŸ•’ Time Complexity: O(N)  
    - Each node is visited once â†’ O(N), where N is the number of nodes.

    ðŸ–¥ Space Complexity: O(N) (worst case), O(log N) (best case) -> is based on the recursion depth
    - Best case: O(log N) for a balanced tree.
    - Worst case: O(N) for a skewed tree (linked list like tree)
