# WHAT IS A HEAP?
# =============================================================================
"""
A heap is a binary tree data structure where:
- Parent node is always smaller (min-heap) or larger (max-heap) than children
- Tree is complete (filled left to right, level by level)
- Root contains the minimum (min-heap) or maximum (max-heap) element

Heap Visual Examples - 3 Levels Each

MIN-HEAP (parent <= children):
      1
     / \
    3   2
   / \ / \
  7  5 4  6

Array representation: [1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6]
- Root (1) is smallest element
- Parent at index i, children at 2i+1 and 2i+2
- 3 <= 7,5 and 2 <= 4,6 (heap property satisfied)
- Python's heapq implements min-heap by default

MAX-HEAP (parent >= children):
      10
     /  \
    8    9
   / \  / \
  4  6 5   3

Array representation: [10, 8, 9, 4, 6, 5, 3]
- Root (10) is largest element  
- 8 >= 4,6 and 9 >= 5,3 (heap property satisfied)
- Python heapq simulates this with negatives: [-10, -8, -9, -4, -6, -5, -3]

Key properties:
- O(log n) insertion and extraction
- O(1) access to min/max element
- Implemented as array for efficiency

# HEAP IMPLEMENTATION NUANCES
# =============================================================================
"""
PYTHON HEAPQ SPECIFICS:
- Only implements min-heap
- Use negative values for max-heap: heappush(-x), -heappop()
- heapify() is O(n), faster than n insertions
- Heap property: parent <= children, but siblings unordered

MAX-HEAP SIMULATION:
- Store negatives: [1,3,2] becomes [-1,-3,-2] 
- Extract with negation: -heappop() gives maximum
- Comparison logic reverses with negatives

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Forgetting to negate when extracting from max-heap
- Assuming heap is fully sorted (only root is guaranteed min/max)
- Not handling empty heap cases
"""

# =============================================================================
# WHEN TO USE HEAPS
# =============================================================================
"""
Use heaps when you need:
- Repeated access to min/max element
- Kth largest/smallest element
- Priority-based processing
- Streaming data with order requirements

Don't use heaps when:
- Need full sorting (just use sort())
- Random access to middle elements
- All elements need to be processed in order
"""

# =============================================================================
# TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY
# =============================================================================
"""
TIME COMPLEXITY:
- heappush(): O(log n) - bubble up operation
- heappop(): O(log n) - bubble down operation  
- heapify(): O(n) - build heap from array
- peek (access root): O(1)

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- O(n) for storing n elements
- O(1) additional space for operations

COMPARISON WITH ALTERNATIVES:
- Sorted array: O(n log n) to sort, O(1) to access min/max
- Heap: O(n) to build, O(log n) per operation
- Use heap when you don't need full sorting, just min/max access

# PROBLEM-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS  
# =============================================================================
"""
FIND KTH LARGEST (LC 215):
- Min-heap of size k: root is kth largest
- Alternative: max-heap, pop k-1 times to get kth largest

RANKING PROBLEMS (LC 506):
- Store (score, original_index) to maintain position mapping
- Max-heap gives natural ordering for ranking

STREAMING KTH LARGEST (LC 703):
- Maintain invariant: heap size â‰¤ k
- Root always contains kth largest seen so far

SIMULATION PROBLEMS (LC 1046, 2558):
- Max-heap for "take largest" operations
- Process until termination condition

DIGIT REARRANGEMENT (LC 2231):  
- Separate heaps maintain largest available digit of each type
- Reconstruct following original pattern

# =============================================================================
# KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR INTERVIEWS
# =============================================================================
"""
1. Know when problem needs repeated min/max access
2. Master max-heap simulation with negatives  
3. Use heapify() for O(n) heap construction
4. Consider maintaining heap invariants (like size k)
5. Handle edge cases: empty heap, single element
6. Remember: heap gives min/max, not full sorting
7. For kth largest: min-heap of size k is often optimal
