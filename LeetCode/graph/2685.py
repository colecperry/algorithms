# 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components

# Topics: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union Find, Graph

# You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.

# Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

# A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

# A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

# Example 1:

#     5        0 ----- 1       3
#               \     /        |
#                \   /         |
#                 \ /          4
#                  2

# Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.

# Example 2:

#            0 ----- 1       5 ------ 3
#             \     /                /
#              \   /                /
#               \ /                /
#                2                4

# Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.

# How to Solve: 
# - Use BFS to explore each connected component of the graph.
# - For each component:
#     - Track the number of nodes and the number of edges.
#     - A component with k nodes is complete if it has exactly (k * (k - 1)) -> each node needs to connect to (k - 1) other nodes, and you multiply by k to count every edge twice (undirected), and divide by 2 to get the expected edges -> basically in the algo we count the edges both ways for each node in the connected component, and then divide that by two and compare to the expected edges calculation
# - Count how many components meet this condition.

# Implementation Details:
# 1. Build an adjacency list from the input edges using defaultdict(list) for convenience.
# 2. Use a `visited` set to track which nodes have been seen already, so we donâ€™t revisit them.
# 3. For every unvisited node from 0 to n-1:
#     - Start a BFS from that node to find all nodes in its connected component.
#     - As we traverse, count:
#         a. The number of nodes in the component.
#         b. The total number of incident edges (i.e., sum of degrees).
# 4. Once the component is fully traversed:
#     - Compute the expected number of undirected edges for a complete graph of size k: (k * (k - 1)) // 2.
#     - Since we counted each undirected edge twice (once from each node), divide `edge_count` by 2.
#     - If actual == expected, increment the count of complete components.
# 5. Return the total number of complete components found.
